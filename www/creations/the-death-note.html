	My name is Lucas Turnery. Recently on the 3rd of October right as I was
	walking out of my 7th period applied mathematics and science class I came
	across a notebook lying on the ground facedown, the notebook was a black as
	the darkest parts of the night sky or as the deepest depths of the ocean. Out
	of curiosity I picked up the notebook and did a cursory inspection, on the
	side that was lying down was big heavily serifed bloodshot red letters
	spelling out the two words “Death Note”. The whole notebook seemed very nicely
	and attentively put together, the outside covering of the notebook felt like a
	mix of paper and leather, with the text “Death Note” being heavily embossed.
	At that point I should have put the book down and walked away like nothing
	ever happened. I was simply too curious to put it down, why would someone
	spend this much time making a book like this? I cautiously opened the book as
	to not damage it, but also out a slight bit of fear for what this “Death Note”
	might contain. The first page just had eleven words, the eleven words that
	would change my life ever, “The human whose name is written in this note shall
	die.” The page itself much like the cover was pitch black, but the letters
	were bright white, comparable to a pure white cumulus cloud, the letters
	themselves were both chaotically written, but entirely legible, they just felt
	like they belonged in such a book. Out of fear I slowly closed the book,
	carefully hid the notebook in the bottom of my backpack, then continued on to
	home like normal, catching Bus 2001 to my bus stop and walking 5 minutes home.
	I did not want to be caught with it or seem suspicious at all, on the off
	chance that this was not just some stupid yet very well put together prank by
	another student at my school.
</p>
<p>
	The next day I went out to my town's local Seven-Eleven, my favorite
	convenience store, it was a thirty minute but definitely worth it bike ride. I
	simply love the Slushie from Seven-Eleven, the Coca-Cola mixed with Pina
	Colada is simply amazing. While checking out I heard a woman scream,
	immediately I scanned my surroundings out of the corner of my eyes I saw a
	woman, she was about 5 feet and 2 inches tall with thick bright curly blonde
	hair. Her mouth was wide open as she screamed, there was a guy standing behind
	her who appeared to be trying to drag her away. The next second she screamed
	“Stop it Luis Hawkins, stop now!” The man who was apparently named “Luis
	Hawkins” replied with “It will all be okay, I let you go when I’m done.” The
	woman, whose name I did not yet nor ever did learn locked eyes with me and
	mouthed out what appeared to be the words “Help Me” with her cold industrial
	grey eyes pleading the same. I immediately knew what I had to do, I opened up
	my backpack and grabbed the Death Note, something I had brought along simply
	because I did not want my parents to search my room and find it. I took out of
	my bag and slowly opened it, flipped past the first page, further than I had
	gotten previously and just blanks lines of clean paper. I carefully and calmly
	wrote down the name I had heard her scream out just 10 seconds before “Luis
	Hawkins.” Once I lifted the pen, I heard yet another scream, this scream was
	different like before the scream was filled with terror, but it also contained
	another element, an element of joy. I looked over and the man has dropped to
	the ground clutching his chest where his heart would be. It appeared that he
	had suffered from a heart the instant I finished writing his name. Out of both
	fear what I had just done I grabbed my bike and biked home. I needed to get
	away from the crime scene, my crime scene. I was wearing a dark black hoodie
	at the time that obscured my face almost completely and as always paid fully
	in cash so there was no record of me being there. I even threw away my well
	beloved Slushie on the way home so that there was no proof of me ever being
	there. It was the moment that I got home and sat down on my bed that I
	realized the extent to what I had just done. This was not some stupid prank
	setup by a student at my school, no I had just commited a murder in cold
	blood, I could not even claim self defence as I was not the one being
	attacked, and with Florida being a death penalty state I could very well be
	executed for my crime.
</p>
<p>
	I realized I was left with a decision, well actually many decisions, but I
	narrowed it down to two main ones. I could either A, turn in the book to the
	police, explain the whole situation around the women and me not even knowing
	if the book was real then hope they believe me and don’t have me executed for
	the murder of Luis Hawkins. With I was going to be hopefully be able to get
	the murder off of my consquences and not live the rest of my life in fear of
	being caught. That was if it went well of the course, on the flip side of this
	hypothetical coins of my life, they could decide to pin other mysterious
	murders on me, try me in secret due to being a “national security threat”, and
	then subsequently quietly execute me. I always had option B, I could simply
	burn the book. If I did that the book would simply leave my life with my life
	hopefully going back to what it was before I ever took that notebook home. The
	negatives this would be living in fear of me getting caught, I would always be
	on edge because maybe the security camera did pick me up, maybe that women had
	seen me before and knew who I was, there was always the chance that I could
	brought in and if they asked for that notebook I would have no excuse. If it
	came out that I had burned it they would definitely be highly suspicious, but
	they would have a hard time creating a case against me.
</p>
<p>
	The next morning I woke up and knew what I had to do. I had to go to the
	police, with it hopefully clearing my conscience and ending in my favor,
	though with the police that is never known in advance. At around 10 in the
	morning I got on my bike and headed into the police station, it was a
	nerve-racking 15 minute ride from my house. I walked up to the front desk
	requested to talk with the police chief saying “I need to speak with the
	police chief, I have commited murder.” The woman at the front desk, with a
	name tag soley saying Anny, sounding concerned, but also doubtful replied
	“Sure thing dear, just sit right there.” Not even five minutes later I was
	called to the back of the station. The officer’s name was Kevin Folly, or at
	least that was what his nametag said. He sat me down in a small concrete room,
	that resembled a jail cell, I wondered if it was foreshadowing. The room had a
	sturdy looking wooden table in the middle painted a dark grey, with the paint
	chipping around the edges to show its light brown wood. On one end of the
	table there was a firm aluminum chair. It resembled an Emeco 1006, but I was
	not sure. On the other side of the table was a comfy looking chair with a
	breathable thin polyester backings and seat, it resembled a Herman Miller
	Aeron. I sat down in the aluminum chair with Officer Folly sitting in the
	other. He placed a tape recorder down on the table, hit record, then placed
	another almost identical looking recorder, that had “ID:k084” written on its
	side unlike the other with “ID: a483.” He then calmly said “Tell me
	everything.” I immediately did, starting with my discovery of the death note,
	ending with my decision to come here this morning. The whole time Officer
	Folly sat there in complete silence, no facial reactions at all, he just sat
	there taking everything in. When I finished telling my tale he asked if I had
	the notebook with me, I replied that I did. He then asked me to take it. I
	slowly took it out of my bag and placed it on the table. He then walked over
	to me, asked me not to resist and put me in handcuffs. At the same time he
	said “You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be
	used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney. If you
	cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you.” I was then ushered
	into a cell on the other side of the police station. That is where I currently
	reside, I am writing this as a way to get my story out and hopefully get
	myself released, but I fear the worst. It has been around three weeks that I
	have been in this cell, being provided no information about how long I will be
	in here, a phone call home, or even if I will ever get a trial. I fear the
	government, like all criminals they most despise or fear will just have me
	disappear. To make matters worse I heard from a guard that they might be
	pinning a spree of unsolved murders on me, typical of the police force, a
	simple way to get their solve rate up and make the department look better.
